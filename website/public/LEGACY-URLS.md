# Legacy URLs

These files were copied verbatim from `jstorrent.github.io` (the old jstorrent.com site)
to keep them working for ~60k legacy Chrome App users. Remove once the legacy app
migration is complete.

## Source repo

`~/code/jstorrent.github.io` (GitHub Pages, formerly CNAME: jstorrent.com, now new.jstorrent.com)

## Not copied

- `index.html`, `404.html` — redirect stubs (would cause loops since jstorrent.com now serves the new site)
- `privacy.html` — new site has a newer version
- `passwordmaker/` — unrelated utility, not needed
